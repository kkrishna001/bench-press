# Bench Press
Bench press is a starter project that I use for,
  1. Evaluating various Android architectures.
  2. Tuning my workflow and build "muscle-memory" to maximize productivity while building features.

## Exercises
There are a total of 6 exercises. The exercises are intentionally kept simple in order to focus on the architecture and workflow.
Each exercise brings in various aspects of the platform for the developer to get a sense of how the architecture would fit into
several real life scenarios.

### 1. Counter
A simple counter application that has an increment and decrement button.

### 2. Hello, Stranger
An application that displays a greeting when a user types their name.

### 3. BMI
BMI calculator problem with some domain modeling, persistent settings and initial configuration. 

### 4. Log in
Exercise deals with network call and saving the user token to the disk.

### 5. Image Picker [WIP]
Handling Android permissions and Activity results.

### 6. Quiz [WIP]
Quiz app with timer, database and fragment to deal with state saving / restoration and multiple async sources.
